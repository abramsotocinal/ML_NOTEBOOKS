# Repo of Datascience and ML Notebooks

I used to have a bunch of notebooks saved for learning, and would go back and read these every once in a while for personal reference. 

BUT I didn't get a chance to back up my work and were all lost(not just the notebooks, but the women and children too) after the reformat.

So... I'm saving them into a git repo instead
